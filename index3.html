        When the <span class="bionic">days</span> are <span class="bionic">tough</span> and the <span class="bionic">moments</span> feel <span class="bionic">long</span>,<br>
        Know you're <span class="bionic">not</span> alone, you’ve <span class="bionic">always</span> been <span class="bionic">strong</span>.<br>
        Though your <span class="bionic">body</span> may <span class="bionic">ache</span> and the <span class="bionic">road</span> seem <span class="bionic">unclear</span>,<br>
        You’ve got the <span class="bionic">strength</span> to <span class="bionic">face</span> it, I’m <span class="bionic">always</span> <span class="bionic">near</span>.<br><br>

        With every <span class="bionic">challenge</span>, you <span class="bionic">stand</span> <span class="bionic">tall</span> and <span class="bionic">brave</span>,<br>
        Fighting through the <span class="bionic">storms</span>, every <span class="bionic">wave</span> you <span class="bionic">brave</span>.<br>
        The <span class="bionic">hard</span> times will <span class="bionic">pass</span>, the <span class="bionic">pain</span> will <span class="bionic">subside</span>,<br>
        And you’ll <span class="bionic">rise</span> again, with <span class="bionic">courage</span> as your <span class="bionic">guide</span>.<br><br>

        There’s <span class="bionic">power</span> in you, <span class="bionic">quiet</span> and <span class="bionic">bright</span>,<br>
        More than you <span class="bionic">realize</span>, you’re <span class="bionic">full</span> of <span class="bionic">light</span>.<br>
        When it feels <span class="bionic">overwhelming</span>, and you start to <span class="bionic">sway</span>,<br>
        I’m here for you, <span class="bionic">every</span> step of the <span class="bionic">way</span>.<br><br>

        No <span class="bionic">moment</span> too <span class="bionic">dark</span>, no <span class="bionic">pain</span> too <span class="bionic">deep</span>,<br>
        I’m with you <span class="bionic">always</span>, even in your <span class="bionic">sleep</span>.<br>
        You’re <span class="bionic">stronger</span> than you <span class="bionic">know</span>, with every <span class="bionic">breath</span>,<br>
        And I’ll <span class="bionic">stand</span> by you, through <span class="bionic">every</span> <span class="bionic">step</span>.<br>
